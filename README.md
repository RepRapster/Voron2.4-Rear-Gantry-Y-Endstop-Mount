# Voron2.4-Rear-Gantry-Y-Endstop-Mount

After installing the btt ebb42 canbus and removing the x y cable chains i tried the ab motor mount y endstop mod but found it moved y max forward about 1mm which affected my euclid gantry mount deploy and stowing so i designed an adjustable gantry mounted y endstop with jst 2 pin socket connection and the wires go easily through the z cable chain to the electronics compartment, the mount fixes to the rear gantry via 2x M5 screws with T nuts and has 2 M3 heatsets installed to mount the endstop holder which uses the normal omron endstop switch fitted with standard bom 2x M2x10 self tapping screws.
